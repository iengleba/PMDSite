<h1>
   The Founders' Creed
</h1>

	
<p>
   I Believe in <strong>Democracy</strong>... a democracy characterized by the practice of justice in every relation of life. I hold that justice is the foremost principle to be 
   considered in making my decisions as a voting member of Phi Mu Delta, the student body, and as a citizen of the United States. I believe in that broad conception of democracy 
   which seeks freedom of opportunity, and recognizes no color, race, creed, or position.
</p>
<p>
   I Believe in <strong>Service</strong>... service to the college; service to every group organized for the common good; service to the individual. I believe in service defined in 
   the terms of voluntary sacrifice for the welfare of those with whom I come in contact.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
   I Believe in<strong> Brotherhood</strong>... Brotherhood that reaches beyond the limits of Phi Mu Delta and welcomes every man as my Brother. I believe in the intrinsic worth of 
   the man at my side, and in his ability to make good and justify my faith in him.
</p>
<p>
   I hold these beliefs as my profound conviction, and I pledge my fellow men to live up to them to the best of my ability.&nbsp;
