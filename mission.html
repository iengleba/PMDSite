<h1> Our Misson: </h1>
<p> Phi Mu Delta was established as a national organization in 1912. The first men's fraternity that, from its inception, welcomed everyone regardless of race, creed, religion, or position. The Lock Haven chapter has been around since 1969 and pledges to live the creed: Brotherhood, Service, Democracy. In Phi Mu Delta, you will see a close-knit group of young men dedicated to improving their school, their community, each other, and themselves. 
Everyone has a vote and everyone matters, no matter who you are or where you come from. We hope you will make the best decision you can, and join the fastest growing social fraternity, with an incredible nationwide membership." </p>
<p> Garrett J. Davis, <br />
 Phi Mu Delta - Mu Zeta President </p>
